Please Use that Thread for Discussion / Feedback that would like me to reply to. 
Ideally Bugs should be logged on GitHub although in the discussion thread is also fine.

This mod allows you to place shield generators. They are expensive and power hungry but can really strengthen your defences. The standard shields will stop projectiles that try to enter it, but allow weapons to be fired out.
This is the Basic version that functions the same as it did in Alpha 13, I have some ideas for a more advanced version, but donâ€™t know When / If that will be Released.
