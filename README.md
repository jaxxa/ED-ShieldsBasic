# ED-ShieldsBasic
This is the Readme for the Enhanced Development Mod, ED-ShieldsBasic, for the Game Rimworld.

This mod allows you to place shield generators. They are expensive and power hungry but can really strengthen your defences. The standard shields will stop projectiles that try to enter it, but allow weapons to be fired out.
This is the Basic version that functions the same as it did in Alpha 13, I have some ideas for a more advanced version, but donâ€™t know When / If that will be Released.

Additional details can be found in About.xml
